# Background

I have grown up with the Internet in South Africa and have over 19 years of work in IT under my belt.

From an early age I was interested in computers.

## First computer

![ZX Spectrum](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/33/ZXSpectrum48k.jpg/220px-ZXSpectrum48k.jpg "ZX Spectrum 16k")

My first (actually my father's) computer was a [ZX Spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX_Spectrum#ZX_Spectrum_16K.2F48K) 

You plugged it into your TV and waited ***HOURS*** for programs to load from cassette tapes. It was a ***HUGE*** deal when we descided to upgrade from 16 Kilobytes of RAM to 48 Kilobytes.

## Downhill from there

I have struggled for most of my career to find out what I actually am, and still think I'm making things up as I go along.
